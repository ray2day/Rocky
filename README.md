March 2022 I did this 'Introduction to ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 5)'-course as intermezzo to learn more about the history and basics of ASP.NET Core MVC. In this course I learned how to build a small application with CRUD operations using Entity Framework for integration with a database with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages. This is the complete and final code.
